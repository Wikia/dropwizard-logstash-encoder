# dropwizard-logback-logstash-encoder

[Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.io/) logging addon for sending logs using the [logstash-logback-encoder](https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder). This is needed because Dropwizard overwrites the default mechanism for loading logback configuration (logback.xml) in favor of its application.yml files.

## Installation
Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.wikia</groupId>
  <artifactId>dropwizard-logstash-encoder</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage
You must configure dropwizard to use these appenders in your application.yml file. There are 3 different 
appenders available: socket, tcp, and file. To configure each set the proper appender type:

## Logstash socket
```yml
logging:
  appenders:
    - type: logstash-socket
      ...
```

## Logstash tcp
```yml
logging:
  appenders:
    - type: logstash-tcp
      ...
```

## Logstash file 
```yml
logging:
  appenders:
    - type: logstash-file
      ...
```

# Common fields across all appenders

* `includeCallerInfo` - boolean
* `includeContext` - boolean
* `includeMdc` - boolean
* `customFields` - hashmap - the configuration differs from the original logstash-logback-encoder config in that this is not a raw json string (see example below)
* `fieldNames` - hashmap

# Settings available to logstash-tcp and logstash-socket

* `host` - string - maps to `syslogHost` when using `logstash-socket`, and `remoteHost` when using `logstash-tcp`
* `port` - int
* `queueSize` - int - only valid for `logstash-tcp`
* `includeCallerData` - bool - only valid for `logstash-tcp`

# Settings available to logstash-file

These settings are the same as the dropwizard [file appender](http://www.dropwizard.io/manual/configuration.html#file) settings except
without the log pattern. Defaults in parenthesis.

* `currentLogFilename` - (REQUIRED)	The filename where current events are logged.
* `threshold` -	(ALL) The lowest level of events to write to the file.
* `archive`	- (true) Whether or not to archive old events in separate files.
* `archivedLogFilenamePattern` - (none)	Required if archive is true. The filename pattern for archived files. %d is replaced with the date in yyyy-MM-dd form, and the fact that it ends with .gz indicates the file will be gzipped as itâ€™s archived. Likewise, filename patterns which end in .zip will be filled as they are archived.
* `archivedFileCount` -	(5) The number of archived files to keep. Must be between 1 and 50.
* `timeZone` -	(UTC) The time zone to which event timestamps will be converted.

# Examples

Example config:
```yaml
logging:
  appenders:
    - type: logstash-socket
      host: 127.0.0.1
      fieldNames:
        message: msg
        timestamp: log_date
      customFields:
        myTestField1: myTestVal
        myTestField2: 2
```

Then, loggers can be used the same way as if they were configured using logback.xml for logstash-logback-encoder, example (using Guava):
```java
LoggerFactory.getLogger("myTestLogger").warn(
	appendEntries(
		new ImmutableMap.Builder<String, Object>()
			.put("some_key", 1)
			.put("some_other_key", "two")
			.build()
	),
	"warning! warning!");
```
